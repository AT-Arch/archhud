Arch HUD

This addon provides a lightweight LUA only HUD including:
- Health bar
- Armor and player name/team display
- Ammo (clip / reserve)
- Mini-radar showing players and NPCs
- Dynamic compass

Name, Team, and Stamina presentation or configurable through main file using return functions. I'd recommend you download the addon manually or use the github to use this on a server.

If configured, this can be used in DarkRP, Helix, NutScript, ETC.

Toggle the HUD from the client console:

archhud_toggle

```pwsh
archhud_toggle
```

Install
1. Copy the `archhud_addon` folder into your `garrysmod/addons/` directory.
